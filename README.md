# Coin Flipper

This small coin flipping application was created as an assignment for the Modern React Bootcamp by Colt Steele.

The purpose of this application is to learn how to manage state and set state/props in parents components which them pass them down to "dumb" components. In addition to the core functionality as specified by the assignment, I added a coin flipping animation as well as reset functionality.
